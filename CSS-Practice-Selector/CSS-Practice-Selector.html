            <p>Lorenzo Ghiberti, (born c. 1378, Pelago, Italy—died December 1, 1455, Florence), early Italian Renaissance sculptor, whose doors (Gates of Paradise; 1425–52) for the Baptistery of the cathedral of Florence are considered one of the greatest masterpieces of Italian art in the Quattrocento. Other works include three bronze statues for Orsanmichele (1416–25) and the reliefs for the cathedral in Siena (1417–27). Ghiberti also wrote I Commentarii, three treatises on art history and theory from antiquity to his time.</p>

            <p>The entry panels of Ghiberti and of Filippo Brunelleschi are the sole survivors of the contest. Ghiberti’s panels displayed a graceful and lively composition executed with a mastery of the goldsmith’s art. In 1402 Ghiberti was chosen to make the doors by a large panel of judges; their decision brought immediate and lasting recognition and prominence to the young artist. The contract was signed in 1403 with Bartolo di Michele’s workshop—overnight the most prestigious in Florence—and in 1407 Lorenzo legally took over the commission.</p>
